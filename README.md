# Confirmation Bias Browser Extension
A Firefox browser extension designed to mitigate confirmation bias in media consumption.

## About
More about confirmation bias on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias. <br>
This is an open source project created by Alex Nathanson. <br> 
Full project details and notes on my methodology are available at https://github.com/alexnathanson/ConfirmationBias_BrowserExtension. <br>
Collaborators welcome. 

## Methodology
The vector assigned to each media source is deeply subjective. The trust variation isn't a measure of trustworthyness or truthfullness, rather it is a relational value. Someone who trusts The Indypendent will not trust Breitbart or vice versa, and the value I've assigned to them is meant to describe this gap.

* Anonymously compare multiple user's behaviour to each other to measure trends and make more relevant recommendations
